        <h2 id="introduction">ABOUT </h2>
        <p>Subhas Chandra Bose was an Indian political leader and nationalist dedicated to Indian independence. He is
            often referred to as Netaji, meaning ‘respected leader’.

            Bose was born in 1897 to a Hindu–Bengali family, and raised in Cuttack, Orissa, where his father worked as a
            lawyer. After graduating with a philosophy degree in Calcutta (today Kolkata) in 1919, he went to Cambridge
            University to study for the Indian Civil Service. However, after passing his exams he decided to dedicate
            himself to the Indian nationalist movement instead.

            In Calcutta he joined the Indian National Congress (INC) and rose through the ranks. During this time he was
            in and out of jail for taking part in violent actions protesting against British colonial rule. He gained
            strong support from the public, and in 1930 he was even elected as mayor of Calcutta whilst in prison. Bose
            disagreed with some of the INC’s policies, particularly Gandhi’s principle of non-violent civil
            disobedience. Between 1933 and 1937 he lived in Europe while recovering from ill health. He visited several
            European countries to share Indian nationalist ideas, and wrote both The Indian Struggle and his own
            autobiography at this time. In Vienna, Bose met his wife Emilie Schenkl, with whom he later had a daughter.
            In 1938 Bose was elected president of the INC, but a power struggle with other Congress leaders led him to
            resign the next year. Bose then formed the Forward Bloc, a party that demanded immediate action against the
            British.

        <p>
            In 1941 Bose was under British surveillance, but he escaped through Afghanistan in disguise. More than ever
            dissatisfied with the Congress’s efforts, he made his way to Europe to look for support from the Axis powers
            to help drive the British out of India. In Nazi Germany Bose met with Adolf Hitler and set up the Free India
            Centre in Berlin, from where he spent a year broadcasting independence messages. Germany also helped Bose
            establish a small army, the Free India Legion. In 1943 Bose left his wife and daughter behind and moved to
            Japan where he found considerable sympathy for the Indian struggle. He established Azad Hind, the
            Provisional Government of Free India, in Singapore. Japan supported Bose in reviving the Indian National
            Army (INA) in 1943, and some 40,000 soldiers were recruited. Bose also established a women’s regiment led by
            Lakshmi Swaminathan. In 1944 the INA joined Japan’s invasion of India but suffered a devastating defeat. On
            15 August 1945 Bose declared the end of the INA during a radio broadcast from Singapore.
            Three days later, he died in a plane crash in Taiwan.

        <h2>EARLY LIFE</h2>
        <P>
            Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose was born on 23 January, 1897 in Cuttack (Orissa) to Janakinath Bose and
            Prabhavati Devi. Subhash was the ninth child among eight brothers and six sisters. His father, Janakinath
            Bose, was an affluent and successful lawyer in Cuttack and received the title of "Rai Bahadur". He later
            became a member of the Bengal Legislative Council.

            Subhash Chandra Bose was a brilliant student. He passed his B.A. in Philosophy from the Presidency College
            in Calcutta. He was deeply influenced by Swami Vivekananda's teachings and was known for his patriotic zeal
            as a student. In an incident where Bose beat up his professor (E.F. Otten) for his racist remarks, brought
            him notoriety as a rebel-Indian in eyes of the government. His father wanted Netaji to become a civil
            servant and therefore, sent him to England to appear for the Indian Civil Service Examination. Bose was
            placed fourth with highest marks in English. But his urge for participating in the freedom movement was
            intense and in April 1921, he resigned from the coveted Indian Civil Service and came back to India. In
            December 1921, Bose was arrested and imprisoned for organizing a boycott of the celebrations to mark the
            Prince of Wales' visit to India.

            During his stay in Berlin, he met and fell in love with Emily Schenkl, who was of Austrian origin. Bose and
            Emily were married in 1937 in a secret Hindu ceremony and Emily gave birth to a daughter Anita in 1942.
            Shortly after the birth of their daughter, Bose left Germany in 1943 to come back to India.

        <h2>POLITICAL CAREER </h2>
        <P>
            On his return to India, he came under the influence of Mahatma Gandhi and joined the Indian National
            Congress.

            On Gandhiji’s instructions, he started working under Deshbandhu Chittaranjan Das, whom he later acknowledged
            as his political guru.<br>

            <b>1923:</b> Subhas Chandra Bose was elected the President of All India Youth Congress and also the
            Secretary of Bengal State Congress. He was also the editor of the newspaper ‘Forward’, founded by
            Chittaranjan Das.<BR>

            <b>1924: </b>He also served as the CEO of the Calcutta Municipal corporation when Das was the mayor of
            Calcutta.<br>

            <b>1925:</b> He was arrested and sent to prison in Mandalay, where he contracted tuberculosis.<br>

            <b>1927:</b> He was released from prison, and later became the general secretary of the Congress party.<br>

            <b>1928: </b>The Motilal Nehru Committee appointed by the Congress declared in favour of Domination Status,
            Subhas Chandra Bose and Jawaharlal Nehru opposed it. They both asserted that only complete independence for
            India was acceptable.Bose also announced the formation of the Independence League.<br>

            <b>1930:</b> Subhas Chandra Bose was jailed during the Civil Disobedience Movement. He later became the
            Mayor of Calcutta.<br>

            <b>1931:</b> Bose was released after the Gandhi-Irwin pact was signed. He protested against the Gandhi-Irwin
            pact and the suspension of the Civil Disobedience movement especially when Bhagat Singh and his associates
            were hanged.

            He travelled through Europe after this, establishing centres in different European capitals to promote
            politico-cultural contacts between India and Europe.<br>

            <b>1937:</b> He returned to India and was released after Congress won the general elections.<br>
        </P>
        <p>
        <h3><b>Subhas Chandra Bose as President Of Indian National Congress Sessions</b></h3>
        <b>1938:</b> He was elected President of the Haripura Congress Session (Gujarat), during this term as Congress
        President; he talked of planning and setting up a National planning Committee in October that year.<br>

        <b>1939:</b> He also won the presidential election to the Tripuri Congress session, defeating Dr. Pattabhi
        Sitaramayya who had been backed by Mahatma Gandhi and the Congress Working Committee.<br>

        This led to the Tripuri Crisis in Congress due to ideological differences between Bose, who had strong leftist
        thinking and older leaders who were more right-wing thinkers.

        As a result, Bose resigned and formed the ‘Forward Bloc’, the left-wing party within the Congress at Unnao in
        U.P.<br>

        <b>1940:</b> When INC organized Individual Satyagraha, Subash Chandra Bose organized an ‘Anti-Compromise
        Conference’ at Ramgarh, Bihar.<br>
        <br>
        He was arrested by the British shortly afterwards for organizing a protest for the removal of the Holwell
        Monument (Memorium for Blackhole tragedy of Calcutta). He was later released and placed under House arrest in
        Calcutta.<br>

        </p>
        <p>
        <h3>Netaji’s Escape from India</h3>
        <b>1941:</b> Bose escaped house arrest in disguise and travelled out of India. He started garnering support from
        Nazi Germany and even met Adolf Hitler.

        He founded the Free India Center in Berlin and created the Indian Legion (consisting of some 4500 soldiers)
        out of Indian prisoners of war who had previously fought for the British in North Africa before their
        capture by Axis forces.

        Bose was given the honorific title of Netaji in Germany in 1942 by the Indian soldiers of the Indian Legion
        and officials of the Special Bureau for India in Berlin.<BR>

        <b>1942-43: </b>World War II was underway, Nazi Germany was losing footing in the west. In the east Japanese
        were
        advancing rapidly. In India, Bengal Famine and Quit India movement were raging.

            <br>
            Bose vehemently opposed the Congress decision to support the British during the Second World War. With the
            aim to initiate a mass movement, Bose called out to Indians for their whole-hearted participation. There was
            tremendous response to his call “Give me blood and I will give you freedom” and the British promptly
            imprisoned him. In jail, he declared a hunger-srtike. When his health deteriorated, the authorities, fearing
            violent reactions, released him but put him under house-arrest.
        </p>
        <p>
            In January, 1941, Subhash made a planned escape and reached Berlin, Germany via a detour through Peshawar.
            Germans assured him their full support in his endeavours and he gained allegiance of Japan as well. He took
            a perilous journey back east and reached Japan where he assumed command over 40,000 soldiers recruited from
            Singapore and other south East Asian regions. He called his army the ‘Indian National Army’ (INA) and led
            the same to capture the Andaman and Nicobar islands from the British and rechristened it as Shaheed and
            Swaraj Islands. A provisional “Azad Hind Government” started functioning in the captured territories. The
            INA or the Azad Hind Fauj stared for India and crossed Burma Border, and stood on Indian soil on March 18,
            1944. Unfortunately, the tide of the World War turned and the Japanese and German forces surrendered which
            forced him to call off further advancement.

            Indian nationalist leader Subhas Chandra Bose died on 18 August 1945 from third-degree burns sustained after
            the
            bomber in which he was being transported as a guest of Lieutenant General Tsunamasa Shidei of the Imperial
            Japanese Kwantung Army crashed upon take off from the airport in Taihoku, Japanese-occupied Formosa, now
            Taipei,
            Taiwan.The chief pilot, copilot, and General Shidei were instantly killed.

        </p>
        <p>
            Bose, who had become soaked in gasoline before exiting the burning bomber, was transported to the Nanmon
            Military Hospital south of Taihoku, where his extensive upper-body burns were treated for six hours by the
            chief-surgeon Dr Taneyoshi Yoshimi, two other doctors Dr Truruta and Dr Ishii, and half a dozen technical
            staff
            and nurses. Bose went into a coma and died between 9 PM and 10 PM Taihoku time. Bose's chief-of-staff, Col.
            Habib ur Rahman, who had travelled with him, and who lay nearby with severe burns, recovered. Ten years
            later he
            testified at an inquiry commission on Bose's death, the burn marks on his arms conspicuously visible.
            General
            Shidei's descendants commemorate his death every year at the Renkōji Temple in Tokyo, where Bose's ashes are
            also deposited.

        </p>
        <p>
            Many among Subhas Chandra Bose's supporters, especially in Bengal, refused at the time and have refused
            since to
            believe either the fact or the circumstances of his death.Conspiracy theories appeared within
            hours of his death and have persisted since then, keeping alive various martial myths about Bose.
        </p>

    </section>
    <section id="ideologies">
        <h2>IDEOLOGIES</h2>
        <p>
            Subhas Chandra Bose believed that the Bhagavad Gita was a great source of inspiration for the struggle
            against
            the British. Swami Vivekananda's teachings on universalism, his nationalist thoughts and his emphasis on
            social service and reform had all inspired Subhas Chandra Bose from his very young days. The fresh
            interpretation of India's ancient scriptures had appealed immensely to him. Some scholars think that Hindu
            spirituality formed an essential part of his political and social thought. As historian Leonard Gordon
            explains "Inner religious explorations continued to be a part of his adult life. This set him apart from the
            slowly growing number of atheistic socialists and communists who dotted the Indian landscape."
        </p>

        <p>
            Bose first expressed his preference for "a synthesis of what modern Europe calls socialism and fascism" in a
            1930 speech in Calcutta.Bose later criticized Nehru's 1933 statement that there is "no middle road"
            between communism and fascism, describing it as "fundamentally wrong." Bose believed communism would not
            gain
            ground in India due to its rejection of nationalism and religion and suggested a "synthesis between
            communism
            and fascism" could take hold instead. In 1944, Bose similarly stated, "Our philosophy should be a synthesis
            between National Socialism and communism."

        </p>
        <h3>Authoritarianism</h3>
        <p> Bose believed that authoritarianism could bring liberation and reconstruction of Indian society. He
            expressed admiration for the authoritarian methods which he saw in Italy and Germany during the 1930s; he
            thought they could be used to build an independent India.</p>

        <p>To a large number of Congress leaders, Bose programme shared enough similarities with Japanese fascists.[144]
            After getting marginalized within Congress, Bose chose to embrace fascist regimes as allies against the
            British
            and fled India.Bose believed that India "must have a political system—State—of an authoritarian
            character," and "a strong central government with dictatorial powers for some years to come".</p>

        <p>Earlier, Bose had clearly expressed his belief that democracy was the best option for India.However,
            during the war (and possibly as early as the 1930s), Bose seems to have decided that no democratic system
            could
            be adequate to overcome India's poverty and social inequalities, and he wrote that a socialist state similar
            to
            that of Soviet Russia (which he had also seen and admired) would be needed for the process of national
            re-building.[an] Accordingly, some suggest that Bose's alliance with the Axis during the war was based on
            more than just pragmatism and that Bose was a militant nationalist, though not a Nazi nor a Fascist, for he
            supported the empowerment of women, secularism and other liberal ideas; alternatively, others consider he
            might
            have been using populist methods of mobilisation common to many post-colonial leaders.
        </p>
        <h3> Anti-semitism</h3>
        <p> Since before the beginning of the World War II, Bose was opposed to the attempts to grant Jewish refugees
            asylum
            in India.[149][150] The great anti-Jewish pogrom called “the Night of Broken Glass” happened on 9 November
            1938.
            In early December, the pro-Hindu Mahasabha journals published articles lending support to German
            anti-Semitism.
            This stance brought Hindu Mahasabha into conflict with the Congress which, on 12 December, issued statement
            containing references to recent European events. Within the Congress, only Bose opposed this stance of the
            party. After some months in April 1939, Bose refused to support the party motion that Jews can find refuge
            in
            India.</p>

        <p>
            In 1938, Bose had denounced Nazi racial policy and persecution of Jews.However, in 1942 he had published
            an article in the journal Angriff, where he wrote that Indians were true Aryans and the 'brethren' of the
            Germans. Bose added that Swastika (symbol of Nazi Germany) was an ancient Indian symbol. Bose urged that
            anti-Semitism should be part of Indian liberation movement because the Jews assisted the British to exploit
            Indians.The Jewish Chronicle had condemned Bose as "India's anti-Jewish Quisling" over this article.
        </p>

        Roman Hayes describes troubled legacy of Bose with atrocities related to Jews in the following words:-

        <p>
        <blockquote><q>
                The most troubling aspect of Bose's presence in Nazi Germany is not military or political but rather
                ethical.
                His alliance with the most genocidal regime in history poses serious dilemmas precisely because of his
                popularity and his having made a lifelong career of fighting the 'good cause'. How did a man who started
                his
                political career at the feet of Gandhi end up with Hitler, Mussolini, and Tojo? Even in the case of
                Mussolini
                and Tojo, the gravity of the dilemma pales in comparison to that posed by his association with Hitler
                and the
                Nazi leadership. The most disturbing issue, all too often ignored, is that in the many articles,
                minutes,
                memorandums, telegrams, letters, plans, and broadcasts Bose left behind in Germany, he did not express
                the
                slightest concern or sympathy for the millions who died in the concentration camps. Not one of his
                Berlin
                wartime associates or colleagues ever quotes him expressing any indignation. Not even when the horrors
                of
                Auschwitz and its satellite camps were exposed to the world upon being liberated by Soviet troops in
                early 1945,
                revealing publicly for the first time the genocidal nature of the Nazi regime, did Bose react.</q>
        </blockquote>
        </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>QUOTES</h2>
        <P>His most famous quote was <q>Give me blood and I will give you freedom</q> Another famous quote was Dilli
            Chalo ("On to Delhi)!" This was the call he used to give the INA armies to motivate them. Another slogan
            coined by him was "Ittehad, Etemad, Qurbani" (Urdu for "Unity, Agreement, Sacrifice").</P>
